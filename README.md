2. If you are using windows, after installing, you need to increase the wsl2 memory limit to increase performance, if you have 16gb of ram, do the following:
```
cd %UserProfile%
notepad .wslconfig
```

add the following and save:

```
[wsl2]
memory=12GB
```

3. Restart your computer.

4. Run:
```
docker-compose up --build
